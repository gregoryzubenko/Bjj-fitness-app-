	User Action & System Input
	Strategic System Logic/Output
	Principle Supported (Source)
	Initial Assessment & Goals
	User launches the app and inputs personal details including gender, age, size, experience, recovery, and competitive goals (e.g., competition date).
	System utilizes proprietary algorithms to begin building a program specifically for the user's needs.
	Individualization: The periodization plan must be dynamic and adapted to the athlete-specific goal.
	Strength Metrics Input
	User provides current max lifts (e.g., max bench, max deadlift, etc.) or estimates their 1 Rep Max (1RM).
	System establishes the fundamental variable of training intensity (%1RM).
	Strength Stimulus: To develop unbeatable strength, training must occur at over 80% of maximum effort for 3–5 reps in each movement.
	Macrocycle Generation
	(System runs automatically).
	System maps out the long-term plan (macrocycle) and schedules the necessary training blocks (mesocycles), ensuring a gradual progression from high-volume/low-intensity to low-volume/high-intensity.
	Competition Peaking: The system can handle any length of training block (from 4+ weeks) to specifically prepare the user for their competition date.
	Phase 2: Microcycle Planning and Preparation (Contextualization)
The system prepares the daily workout based on the strategic plan and BJJ schedule.

	Principle Supported (Source)
	Phase Check
	System identifies the current mesocycle (e.g., Stabilization Endurance, Maximal Strength, or Power phase).
	This dictates the acute variables for the day, including the load percentage, tempo (e.g., slow tempo 4/2/1 for Stabilization Endurance), volume of reps and sets.
	Structured Progression: Each phase builds upon the last, improving work capacity and preparing the body for higher intensities.
	Exercise List Display
	System displays the "Exercise list fro the workout", ensuring coverage of the six most important movement categories (squat, hip hinge, push, pull, twisting, carrying).
	The selection emphasizes BJJ-specific movements like Bent-Over Rows, Hip Thrusts, and Farmer’s Walk.
	Sport Specificity: Exercise selection is based on training the necessary movement patterns, not one specific exercise.
	Exercise Substitution
	User presses the [change exercise] button.
	System offers alternatives (e.g., swapping a conventional Deadlift for a Trap Bar Deadlift or Deadlift from blocks) if the exercise is unsafe or puts too much stress on the low back due to existing BJJ live training.
	Safety and Context: The choice must fit safely within the bigger structure of their plan.
	Warm-up Integration
	User views the pre-programmed warm-up routine.
	The system utilizes features like a Guided Warmups planner to optimize training sessions without causing premature fatigue.
	Optimization: A well-structured warm-up is crucial for optimizing training sessions.
	Phase 3: Workout Execution and Dynamic Feedback (Adjustment Loop)
This phase reflects the real-time coaching where the app learns from the user.
Step in CJM
	User Action & Variable Control
	Strategic System Logic/Output
	Principle Supported (Source)
	Set Execution
	User initiates an exercise (e.g., Floor Press).
	System displays the acute variables: "set 1, reps weight" and potentially tempo/cadence.
	BJJ Specifics: Isometric Overload Training (paused squats) is used, as grapplers are often under tension.
	Performance Input
	After completing the set, the user logs actual reps and provides performance feedback (e.g., RPE/difficulty rating).
	The app learns from user feedback. The app is only as effective as the information the user gives it.
	Track and Adjust: This data allows for Adjustments Every Step of the Way.
	Immediate Adjustment
	(System runs automatically).
	The system adjusts the weight or reps for the next set, ensuring the intensity remains appropriate (e.g., if the user struggles with the 85% 1RM goal).
	Set to Set Adjustments: The app must utilize feedback to refine the program.
	Complex Training
	User performs BJJ-specific complexes (e.g., single-arm pressing with an isometric hold on the opposite arm).
	The system guides the user through complex training, such as Psycho Isometric Training, combining isometric holds with an explosive movement (e.g., an explosive push-up) to improve power output and mental ability.
	Developing Power: Power is the relationship between force and how fast it is applied. This training improves reactive ability from elongated positions.
	Finish Exercise
	User confirms completion and cycles back to the Exercise list.
	Logs the entire session history.
	History Tracking: The more training done with the app, the better it gets at optimizing the program.
	Phase 4: Long-Term Review and Mesocycle Progression
The final phase governs the strategic shifts required to maximize long-term athletic potential.

	System Action & Analysis
	Strategic System Logic/Output
	Principle Supported (Source)
	Block Analysis
	System tracks performance and compliance over the last 4–6 weeks.
	System ensures progressive overloading. The variations in training variables are necessary to keep the client progressing and avoid a plateau.
	Tracks and Grows with You: JuggernautAI utilizes hundreds of data points about training to optimize the program.
	Phase Shift Decision
	(System runs automatically).
	System determines if a Mesocycle phase shift is necessary (typically every 4–6 weeks), transitioning the athlete to the next phase (e.g., from Muscular Development to Maximal Strength).
	Periodization Strategy: Without periodization, the client/athlete may not reach full potential.
	Macrocycle Update
	System updates the long-term plan, dynamically scheduling the next block of training (mesocycle) based on the athlete's progress and upcoming competition schedule.
	The program adjusts to the athlete's feedback to create the best program for them.
	Avoids Plateau: Training requires a variable stimulus; phase shifts prevent the neuromuscular system from adapting to the current training over time.
